# COVID-19 Volunteering Prototype

## Background

I'm a software engineer who is fortunate enough to still have a job, but not everyone is that lucky. I wanted to use some of my spare time after work to maybe work towards an app to do something about the outbreak. I have relatives who have been laid off and have spare time, but don't want to work retail to avoid exposure. They also don't have medical skills.

Based on that, I got to thinking. There has to be something that we can do to mobilize people to do something, while not risking too much exposure. One of my coworkers recently said she was sewing masks for people in the area, and I thought, why can't we encourage others to do so, too? And why can't we get in contact with people who may need it. There has to be a way to do that.

That's what this anticipates to be. Maybe we'll be lucky and this won't be needed and this will be over with soon, but just in case I figured I'd work on this.

## Direction

I'm a developer with 2 years of experience, so I'm not entirely sure of some best practices. But I will do my best to paint a clear picture of what I'd like this to become.

### General Initial Prototype

The first step is to make something basic that works. I've defined that as

- Create a user with basic info
- User can volunteer -- offer to
  - Cook meals for those in need
  - Transport meals to those in need
  - Make house calls and check up on people
  - Sew masks
- User can request help -- Ask for
  - Meals
  - A Mask
  - Periodic Phone Calls / Check ins / Social discussion

### Make It Barely Usable

Next, we make it into a testing phase where we can add users to get basic feedback on direction, practicality, etc. That includes

- User has to verify phone number (safety purposes)
- Volunteering becomes measureable -- Track when a user
  - Cooks one of three different meals
  - Say they made a mask
- Requesting help shows data
  - Requesting a mask shows the number of
    - Masks requested within 60 miles (100km)
    - Masks created within 60 miles
  - Requesting a meal shows
    - Each meal and the number requested and created within 60 miles
  - Requesting house calls gives you a form to specify how often and what time. **This should be a prioritized feature to get something out the door.**

### Next we work with the logistics and transportation
